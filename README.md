## Welcome to Vitor's show ðŸŽ©

I'm from Minas Gerais, but I'm currently living in SBC - SP.
Passionate about technology, develop solutions that serve people and solve complex problems.
Currently studying software development at Trybe, striving to learn all the content to the fullest, and applying everything I've learned to the projects.
